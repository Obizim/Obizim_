          I'm a front-end developer, based in the UK building applications focusing on creating great user interfaces and good user experiences that are equally accessible. As a developer focused on achieving goals, I bring a dedicated approach to collaboration and resolving problems with a solutions-oriented mindset. I utilize a range of web design technologies to create tailored, customer-centric websites and designs.</p>
          <p>Some of the technologies and tools I have worked with include HTML and CSS, Node/Expressjs Javascript, Typescript, React, Nextjs, Styled-components, TailwindCSS</p>
          <p>
            Tech aside, I love watching movies/shows
