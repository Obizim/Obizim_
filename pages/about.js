          I'm a front-end developer, from Nigeria building applications focusing on creating great user interfaces and good user experiences that are equally accessible. Web animations fascinate me a lot these days too. I go to the awwwards site or Gresnsock's showcase to see what people are building.

          <p>My technical skills include Html and CSS, Javascript, react, redux, nextjs, styled-components, tailwindcss, bootstrap and other js libraries</p>
          <p>
            Tech aside, I love watching movies / tv series , reading books
            (fictions mostly).
